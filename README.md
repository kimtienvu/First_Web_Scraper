# First_Web_Scraper
Playing around with Python, BeautifulSoup, and Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab to create a web scraper

# Notes
Make sure the website explicitly states it is okay to web scrape, otherwise that's a no no!

# Instructions
The program will prompt the user for a URL and display the content of the webpage in HTML format.

If the user wishes to display only a specific tag, for example, if a user only wishes to display all the content inside <p> (paragraph) tags,
simply input "y" (case doesn't matter) when prompted and enter the tag letter (so `p` for the <p> tag, etc).
